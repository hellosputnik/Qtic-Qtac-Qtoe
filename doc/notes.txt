Considerations
==============

 * Smart pointers

   I can probably use unique_ptr and move to manage my memory instead of regular
   pointers.

 * Abstraction of game board

   m x n boards are common. What if the board was generated in a grid layout
   instead of using a predefined board of a predefined size.

 * Abstraction of game piece

   There are various board games. If the game piece was abstract along with the
   game board, the code might be reusable and we create checkers or chess.

 * Rename to xy coordinates instead of NW, N, NE, etc.

   NW, N, NE, etc. would only work with a 3x3. Using xy coordinates would be
   more flexible if the game board and pieces were generated.
